## Process Component Menu

  - **Execution:** This option counts all executions of the current process and is identified with a blue background. This option is both as a quick run and also a drop down list with the process name and description. By default the main action of the run list is always first.

## Field display

For a more minimalistic and simpler view the fields in the process component although they keep the same order are hidden by default unless the field has a default value or are mandatory
